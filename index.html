        <p>ðŸ‘‹ I am a Technical Product Manager living in Washington, DC with my wife and daughter. I was born
        in Kiev, but spent my formative years in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
        <p>My background is in Computer Science and Urban Planning, and I enjoy working on projects
        at the intersection of public policy and technology. (Fun fact, my graduate research analyzed effect of per pupil
        spending on academic achievement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_district">Abbott School Districts</a>.)
        I'm also a big fan of <a href="https://www.datakind.org/do-good-with-data">DataKind</a> and
        had a great experience building <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/colandr">Colandr</a> with them.</p>
        <p>I've worked as a software developer, as a business intelligence consultant, and as a
        product manager for a global <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin">investment
          system</a> used to manage trillions. In 2014, I cofounded
        <a href="https://www.getgrist.com">Grist Labs</a> to help companies big and small manage
        their data simply and securely.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get in touch, please <a href="mailto:stan@stansagalovskiy.com">email me</a>.</p>
